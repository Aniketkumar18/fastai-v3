# Sports Image Classifier

The aim of this project is to classify the image into "Cricket", "Football", "Golf" or "Tennis" using Convolution Nueral Network. In this image classification project I have used the transfer learning from the imagenet data.

After creating and training my model, I have deployed it as a web application on render.
